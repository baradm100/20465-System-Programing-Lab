## Pointer
TD;LR: The place in the memory the variable (that it's points to) is stored in.

## sizeof
Returns the size of the variable. For example:

```c
int i = 100;
char c = 'Bar';

sizeof i; // => 4
sizeof c; // => 1
```

## Moving The Pointer
When we move a pointer (with addition or subtraction), the "units" the pointer "jumps" in the memory by the set size of the variable type. For example:

| Type | Jump Size
| ---- | -----
| int  | 4
| char | 1
